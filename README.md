# Awesomewm-config
This is my configuration for awesomewm. Various pieces have been adapted from diverse sources on the web. I've tried to give proper credit to the sources.

## Installation
1. Install awesome-wm `sudo apt-get install awesome`
2. Clone this repo as `~/.config/awesome/`
3. Start awesome: `awesome`. You may need to tweak this depending on where you run this.
4. Use Super-F1 for help on the keybindings.

### Suspending properly
Follow the directions in `screenlock.service` so that screen locking works 

### Changing display setups
Use [arandr](https://www.mankier.com/1/arandr) to help configure your display setup with a given set of connected displays.

Use [autorandr](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/autorandr/autorandr.1.en.html) to automatically switch display configurations when the connected displays change.
